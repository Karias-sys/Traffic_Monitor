# External APIs

**No External APIs Required**

Based on the PRD requirements and system architecture analysis, Netwatch is designed as a **self-contained network monitoring solution** with no external API dependencies. This aligns with the core design principles of:

**Single-Binary Deployment:** External API dependencies would compromise the zero-infrastructure deployment goal and introduce network dependencies that could affect packet capture performance.

**Air-Gapped Network Compatibility:** Network monitoring often occurs in isolated or secure environments where external API access is restricted or prohibited.

**Performance Isolation:** The 1 Gbps packet processing requirement demands that all system resources focus on local packet analysis without external I/O that could introduce latency or processing delays.

**Operational Independence:** SOCC environments require monitoring tools that continue operating during network outages or connectivity issues that might affect external services.
