# Monitoring and Observability

## Monitoring Stack

- **Frontend Monitoring:** Browser performance API, WebSocket connection tracking, user interaction metrics
- **Backend Monitoring:** Go runtime metrics, custom application metrics, structured logging
- **Error Tracking:** Centralized error logging with context, error rate monitoring and alerting
- **Performance Monitoring:** Packet capture rates, flow processing latency, memory usage trending

## Key Metrics

**Frontend Metrics:**
- Dashboard load time (<2 seconds target)
- WebSocket connection stability (>99% uptime)
- Chart rendering performance (60fps during updates)
- User interaction response time (<100ms)

**Backend Metrics:**
- Packet capture rate (target: sustained 1 Gbps)
- Flow processing latency (<1ms per packet average)
- Memory usage (target: <1GB total)
- API response time (<100ms 95th percentile)
- Active flow count and growth rate
