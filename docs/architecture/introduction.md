# Introduction

## Starter Template or Existing Project

**Analysis:** Based on the PRD and frontend specifications, this is a **greenfield project** with specific architectural constraints:

- **Go monolith backend** with AF_PACKET packet capture (highly specialized)
- **Single-binary deployment** requirement
- **Embedded static web assets** using Go embed
- **Matrix-themed cybersecurity aesthetic**
- **Real-time WebSocket updates**

**Decision:** N/A - Greenfield project with custom Go backend requirements that preclude standard fullstack starters. The specialized packet capture functionality and single-binary constraint necessitate a custom architecture.
