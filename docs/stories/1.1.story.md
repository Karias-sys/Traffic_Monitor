# Story 1.1: Project Foundation Setup

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,  
**I want** a properly configured Go project with build tooling and basic project structure,  
**so that** I can develop and deploy the Netwatch application reliably.

## Acceptance Criteria

5. Structured logging configured with configurable levels (debug, info, warn, error)
6. Version information embedded in binary during build process
7. Basic CI/CD pipeline defined for automated testing and building

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This is the first story, so no previous story context available.

### Project Structure Requirements
Based on unified-project-structure.md, the following directory structure must be created:
- `cmd/netwatch/` - Main application entry point [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#cmd]
- `internal/` - Private application packages (capture/, flow/, api/, websocket/, metrics/, config/) [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#internal]
- `pkg/` - Public library code (types/, logger/, utils/) [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#pkg]
- `web/` - Frontend assets for embedded serving [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#web]
- `tests/` - Test organization (unit/, integration/, e2e/, mocks/) [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#tests]
- `scripts/`, `configs/`, `docs/` - Supporting directories [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

### Tech Stack Constraints
- **Go Version:** Must use Go 1.21+ for slog structured logging support [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-language]
- **Build Tool:** Use Make + Go build for build automation [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#build-tool]
- **Logging:** Must use slog (structured logging) with configurable levels [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#logging]
- **CI/CD:** Use GitHub Actions for automated testing and releases [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#cicd]
- **Dependencies:** Minimize external dependencies, prefer Go standard library [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-framework]

### Configuration Management
Based on backend architecture, configuration system should:
- Support environment variables and CLI flags [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#config]
- Include validation.go for input validation [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#config]
- Provide defaults.go for default values [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#config]
- Follow localhost-first design with optional security [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#authentication]

### Coding Standards
- **Performance Priority:** Maintain <5% CPU usage target [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- **Memory Management:** Implement proper cleanup monitoring [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- **Error Handling:** All errors must be non-blocking for system operation [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- **Function Naming:** Use camelCase for Go functions (e.g., ProcessPacket()) [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#naming-conventions]
- **Package Naming:** Use lowercase for Go packages (e.g., internal/capture) [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#naming-conventions]

### Testing Requirements
Based on testing strategy:
- **Backend Unit Tests:** Organize in tests/unit/ with subpackages matching internal/ structure [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#backend-tests]
- **Test Framework:** Use Go stdlib testing with testify assertions [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-testing]
- **Test Organization:** Create tests/mocks/ for mock implementations [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]
- **Coverage Target:** 200 backend unit tests as per testing pyramid [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#testing-pyramid]

### Version Management
- Embed version information in binary during build process using ldflags
- Support cross-platform builds as specified in tech stack
- Single-binary deployment model [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#iac-tool]

## Testing
**Test Location:** tests/unit/ following unified project structure
**Test Standards:** Go stdlib testing + testify v1.8.0 for assertions
**Test Framework:** Native Go testing with mock implementations in tests/mocks/
**Specific Requirements:**
- Create unit tests for configuration validation
- Test logging level configuration and output formatting
- Verify version embedding in build process
- Test CLI flag and environment variable parsing

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-06

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

Excellent implementation quality overall. The foundation setup demonstrates strong adherence to Go best practices and the specified architecture. The codebase follows clean architecture principles with well-separated concerns across configuration, logging, and application layers. All acceptance criteria have been fully implemented with comprehensive validation and error handling.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: pkg/logger/logger.go:67-70
  - **Change**: Fixed broken WithContext method that was incorrectly calling l.Logger.With() without parameters
  - **Why**: The original implementation would create an invalid logger instance and potentially cause runtime issues
  - **How**: Replaced with proper implementation that returns the logger with context support placeholder, documented for future enhancement

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Follows camelCase naming, proper error handling, and performance-conscious design
- Project Structure: ✓ Perfect adherence to unified-project-structure.md with all required directories
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive unit test coverage with proper organization in tests/unit/
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 7 acceptance criteria fully implemented and verified

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Fixed WithContext method in logger (pkg/logger/logger.go:67-70)
- [x] Verified all tests pass with 100% success rate
- [x] Confirmed build system works correctly with version embedding
- [x] Validated configuration system handles all specified scenarios
- [x] Verified project structure matches requirements exactly

### Security Review

Security configuration properly implemented with optional authentication design. Token validation requires minimum 16 characters when enabled. No secrets or sensitive data exposed in logs. Localhost-first design appropriately implemented for development security model.

### Performance Considerations

Configuration defaults are performance-optimized:
- Buffer size set to 32MB for high throughput
- Flow cleanup interval (30s) balanced for <5% CPU target
- Memory limits enforced (1GB max flow storage)
- Timeout configured at 100ms for optimal responsiveness

### Final Status

✓ Approved - Ready for Done

The project foundation is excellently implemented with professional-grade code quality, comprehensive testing, and full compliance with all specified requirements.
