# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

Based on your brief, here are the key desired outcomes if this PRD is successful:

• **Market Validation**: Prove demand for lightweight, real-time network monitoring solutions
• **Technical Feasibility**: Demonstrate 1 Gbps packet processing capability in production environments  
• **User Adoption**: Achieve positive feedback from 10+ early adopters within 3 months
• **Performance Excellence**: Deliver sub-second network visibility with <5% CPU utilization
• **Deployment Simplicity**: Enable single-binary deployment with zero infrastructure complexity
• **Real-time Intelligence**: Transform raw packets into actionable insights within seconds

## Background Context

Network administrators and DevOps teams face critical visibility gaps when monitoring network traffic in real-time. Traditional solutions require complex infrastructure, provide delayed insights, or are over-engineered for single-host monitoring needs. Current alternatives like Wireshark lack real-time dashboards, while enterprise NPM solutions are expensive and complex for single-host use cases.

Netwatch addresses this gap by providing immediate network intelligence through a lightweight, purpose-built Go application that leverages AF_PACKET ring buffers for efficient packet capture with intelligent flow aggregation and WebSocket-powered real-time updates. The solution targets network administrators managing 10-500 host networks and DevOps engineers needing to correlate network patterns with application performance.
