# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

Netwatch delivers an **operations-focused, data-dense dashboard experience** optimized for rapid network troubleshooting and monitoring workflows. The interface prioritizes **information density over visual polish**, presenting live network data in familiar formats that network administrators can quickly scan and interpret. The design follows a **"network operations center"** paradigm where multiple data streams are visible simultaneously, enabling users to spot patterns and anomalies within seconds of opening the interface.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Real-time Auto-refresh**: All data updates continuously without user intervention, with visual indicators for data freshness
- **Tabbed Navigation**: Primary navigation between Dashboard, Flow Table, and System Health using browser-standard tab interface
- **Search-first Workflows**: Primary interaction model assumes users need to filter/search large datasets quickly
- **Keyboard-friendly**: SOCC analyst optimized shortcuts for rapid operations
- **Matrix-inspired Aesthetics**: Color coding follows familiar cybersecurity matrix themes

## Recommended Keyboard Shortcuts for SOCC Analysts

- **Tab/Shift+Tab**: Navigate between main sections (Dashboard → Flow Table → System Health)
- **F5/Ctrl+R**: Force refresh all data (beyond auto-refresh)
- **Ctrl+F**: Focus search/filter input on current view
- **Ctrl+1/2/3**: Quick jump to Dashboard/Flow Table/System Health tabs
- **Space**: Pause/resume auto-refresh for detailed analysis
- **Esc**: Clear all filters and return to default view
- **Ctrl+E**: Export current view data (future enhancement)

## Core Screens and Views

1. **Real-time Dashboard**: Primary landing page with live bandwidth charts, protocol breakdown, and top talkers
2. **Flow Table Interface**: Detailed, sortable table of all network flows with advanced filtering capabilities  
3. **Flow Detail View**: Expanded view of individual flow with full metadata and historical timeline
4. **System Health Status**: Basic system metrics, capture statistics, and connection status

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

Meeting WCAG 2.1 AA standards to ensure usability for network operations teams with diverse needs, including proper color contrast for monitoring environments and keyboard navigation support.

## Branding

**Matrix-inspired cybersecurity aesthetic** with dark theme default featuring green-on-black primary text, amber warnings, and red critical alerts. Color palette uses classic terminal colors: bright green (#00FF41) for active flows, amber (#FFC107) for moderate traffic/warnings, red (#FF073A) for high traffic/alerts, and cyan (#00BCD4) for system status indicators. Typography emphasizes monospace fonts for IP addresses and technical identifiers, maintaining the authentic "digital rain" operational feeling.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Primary target is **desktop/laptop browsers** in network operations environments, with responsive design supporting tablet access for mobile network troubleshooting. No native mobile apps planned for MVP - web interface optimized for larger screens where data density is manageable.
