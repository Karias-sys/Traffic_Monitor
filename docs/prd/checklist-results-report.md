## Top Issues by Priority

**HIGH:**
- Data retention policy lacks specific eviction algorithms beyond "60-minute constraint"
- Performance monitoring approach needs more detail for production deployment

**MEDIUM:**
- Could benefit from more specific error handling patterns across epics
- Integration testing strategy could be more comprehensive

**LOW:**
- Additional UI wireframes would enhance UX clarity
- More detailed competitive analysis could strengthen positioning

## MVP Scope Assessment

**✅ Scope is Appropriately Minimal:**
- Core packet capture, flow processing, real-time dashboard, and API access
- Clear exclusions (multi-host, persistence, advanced analytics)
- Features directly address primary user needs

**✅ Essential Features Covered:**
- Real-time traffic visibility (primary value prop)
- Flow-level analysis (differentiation from basic tools)
- Programmatic access (integration requirement)

**✅ Timeline Realistic:**
- 5 epics sized for incremental delivery
- Stories appropriately scoped for AI agent execution
- Technical complexity managed through sequential epic structure

## Technical Readiness

**✅ Clear Technical Constraints:**
- Go monolith with AF_PACKET capture clearly specified
- Performance targets (1 Gbps, <5% CPU) well-defined  
- Single-binary deployment requirement maintained throughout

**✅ Technical Risks Identified:**
- Performance risk for 1 Gbps target acknowledged
- AF_PACKET compatibility across distributions noted
- Memory management strategy for 60-minute constraint defined

**✅ Architecture Guidance Complete:**
- Technology stack decisions documented with rationale
- Security and deployment approaches specified
- Integration patterns established

## Final Validation Results

**✅ READY FOR ARCHITECT**

The PRD comprehensively defines the Netwatch MVP with:
- Clear problem statement and user needs
- Well-structured epic breakdown with logical sequencing  
- Complete functional and non-functional requirements
- Detailed technical guidance and constraints
- Appropriate MVP scope balancing value delivery with complexity

The minor gaps in operational requirements do not block architectural design and can be addressed during implementation planning.
