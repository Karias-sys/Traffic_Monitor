# Epic 1: Foundation & Packet Capture Engine

**Epic Goal:** Establish the foundational project infrastructure and core packet capture capability that enables real-time network traffic monitoring. This epic delivers a working packet capture engine with basic system monitoring, providing the essential foundation for all subsequent network analysis features.

## Story 1.1: Project Foundation Setup
As a **developer**,  
I want **a properly configured Go project with build tooling and basic project structure**,  
so that **I can develop and deploy the Netwatch application reliably**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Go module initialized with appropriate module name and Go version constraints
2. Makefile provides build, test, clean, and run targets for development workflow
3. Project directory structure established (cmd/, internal/, web/, docs/)
4. Basic configuration management implemented using environment variables and CLI flags
5. Structured logging configured with configurable levels (debug, info, warn, error)
6. Version information embedded in binary during build process
7. Basic CI/CD pipeline defined for automated testing and building

## Story 1.2: Network Interface Detection
As a **network administrator**,  
I want **the system to detect and validate available network interfaces**,  
so that **I can specify which interface to monitor for packet capture**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. System can enumerate all available network interfaces on the host
2. Interface validation includes checking for appropriate permissions and capabilities
3. Clear error messages provided for insufficient permissions or invalid interface names
4. Default interface selection logic implemented for common deployment scenarios
5. Interface information includes MTU, status, and basic statistics
6. Support for both interface names (eth0) and interface indexes

## Story 1.3: AF_PACKET Raw Socket Implementation  
As a **system**,  
I want **efficient packet capture using AF_PACKET with TPACKETv3 ring buffers**,  
so that **I can capture network traffic at high speeds with minimal system overhead**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. AF_PACKET socket created with TPACKETv3 configuration for specified interface
2. Ring buffer properly configured with appropriate block size and frame count
3. Packet capture loop implemented with efficient memory management
4. Basic packet parsing extracts Ethernet, IP, and transport layer headers
5. Capture statistics tracked (packets received, packets dropped, ring buffer utilization)
6. Graceful handling of capture errors and interface state changes
7. Resource cleanup implemented for proper socket and buffer management

## Story 1.4: Basic HTTP Server & Health Endpoints
As a **network administrator**,  
I want **basic HTTP endpoints to verify system health and capture status**,  
so that **I can confirm Netwatch is running and capturing packets correctly**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. HTTP server listening on configurable localhost port (default 8080)
2. Health check endpoint (/health) returns JSON status including capture state
3. Statistics endpoint (/stats) provides packet capture metrics and system information
4. Proper HTTP error handling and structured JSON responses
5. Request logging for debugging and monitoring purposes
6. Graceful server shutdown handling
7. Basic security headers implemented
