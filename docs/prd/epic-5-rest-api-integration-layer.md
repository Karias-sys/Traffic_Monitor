# Epic 5: REST API & Integration Layer

**Epic Goal:** Provide comprehensive REST API access to all network flow data, metrics, and system status for programmatic integration and automation use cases. This epic enables DevOps teams, monitoring systems, and custom applications to integrate with Netwatch for automated network analysis, alerting, and data export workflows.

## Story 5.1: Core REST API Framework & Documentation
As a **DevOps engineer**,  
I want **a well-documented REST API with consistent response formats and error handling**,  
so that **I can reliably integrate Netwatch data into automated monitoring and alerting systems**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. RESTful API endpoints following consistent URL patterns (/api/v1/{resource})
2. Standardized JSON response format with consistent metadata (timestamp, version, pagination info)
3. HTTP status codes properly implemented (200, 400, 404, 500) with descriptive error messages
4. API documentation auto-generated or maintained alongside code with request/response examples
5. CORS headers configured for cross-origin web application access
6. API versioning strategy implemented to support future enhancements
7. Request logging and metrics collection for API usage monitoring

## Story 5.2: Flow Query & Filtering Endpoints
As a **DevOps engineer**,  
I want **REST endpoints to query flow data with flexible filtering and pagination**,  
so that **I can retrieve specific network flow information for automated analysis and reporting**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. GET /api/v1/flows endpoint with query parameters for filtering (ip, port, protocol, time_start, time_end)
2. Pagination support with limit/offset parameters and response metadata (total_count, has_more)
3. Flow data response includes all essential fields (src_ip, dst_ip, ports, protocol, bytes, packets, timestamps)
4. Query parameter validation with clear error messages for invalid inputs
5. Time-based filtering supports ISO 8601 timestamps and relative time expressions (5m, 1h)
6. Response format optimized for programmatic consumption with consistent field naming
7. Performance optimization for large result sets with streaming response support

## Story 5.3: Real-time Metrics & Statistics Endpoints
As a **monitoring system**,  
I want **REST endpoints providing current network statistics and system health metrics**,  
so that **I can integrate Netwatch metrics into centralized monitoring dashboards and alerting systems**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. GET /api/v1/metrics endpoint providing current bandwidth utilization, packet rates, and protocol distribution
2. GET /api/v1/stats/system endpoint exposing system health (CPU usage, memory usage, capture statistics)
3. GET /api/v1/stats/flows endpoint providing flow table statistics (active flows, flow rate, top talkers)
4. Historical metrics endpoints supporting time-based queries for trend analysis
5. Metrics format compatible with common monitoring systems (Prometheus exposition format option)
6. Real-time metrics updated at same frequency as WebSocket streams for consistency
7. Cache headers implemented appropriately for different metric types and update frequencies

## Story 5.4: API Authentication & Rate Limiting
As a **system administrator**,  
I want **API security controls including authentication and rate limiting**,  
so that **I can control access to network monitoring data and prevent API abuse**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Optional token-based authentication (Bearer token) for API endpoints when security mode enabled
2. Rate limiting implemented per client/token with configurable limits (requests per minute/hour)
3. Rate limit headers included in responses (X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Reset)
4. Authentication bypass for localhost connections when running in development/testing mode
5. API key management through configuration file or environment variables
6. Graceful rate limit responses (429 status) with retry-after headers
7. Security headers implemented (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
