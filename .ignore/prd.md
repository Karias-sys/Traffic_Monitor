# Netwatch Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

Based on your brief, here are the key desired outcomes if this PRD is successful:

• **Market Validation**: Prove demand for lightweight, real-time network monitoring solutions
• **Technical Feasibility**: Demonstrate 1 Gbps packet processing capability in production environments  
• **User Adoption**: Achieve positive feedback from 10+ early adopters within 3 months
• **Performance Excellence**: Deliver sub-second network visibility with <5% CPU utilization
• **Deployment Simplicity**: Enable single-binary deployment with zero infrastructure complexity
• **Real-time Intelligence**: Transform raw packets into actionable insights within seconds

### Background Context

Network administrators and DevOps teams face critical visibility gaps when monitoring network traffic in real-time. Traditional solutions require complex infrastructure, provide delayed insights, or are over-engineered for single-host monitoring needs. Current alternatives like Wireshark lack real-time dashboards, while enterprise NPM solutions are expensive and complex for single-host use cases.

Netwatch addresses this gap by providing immediate network intelligence through a lightweight, purpose-built Go application that leverages AF_PACKET ring buffers for efficient packet capture with intelligent flow aggregation and WebSocket-powered real-time updates. The solution targets network administrators managing 10-500 host networks and DevOps engineers needing to correlate network patterns with application performance.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

Netwatch delivers an **operations-focused, data-dense dashboard experience** optimized for rapid network troubleshooting and monitoring workflows. The interface prioritizes **information density over visual polish**, presenting live network data in familiar formats that network administrators can quickly scan and interpret. The design follows a **"network operations center"** paradigm where multiple data streams are visible simultaneously, enabling users to spot patterns and anomalies within seconds of opening the interface.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Real-time Auto-refresh**: All data updates continuously without user intervention, with visual indicators for data freshness
- **Tabbed Navigation**: Primary navigation between Dashboard, Flow Table, and System Health using browser-standard tab interface
- **Search-first Workflows**: Primary interaction model assumes users need to filter/search large datasets quickly
- **Keyboard-friendly**: SOCC analyst optimized shortcuts for rapid operations
- **Matrix-inspired Aesthetics**: Color coding follows familiar cybersecurity matrix themes

### Recommended Keyboard Shortcuts for SOCC Analysts

- **Tab/Shift+Tab**: Navigate between main sections (Dashboard → Flow Table → System Health)
- **F5/Ctrl+R**: Force refresh all data (beyond auto-refresh)
- **Ctrl+F**: Focus search/filter input on current view
- **Ctrl+1/2/3**: Quick jump to Dashboard/Flow Table/System Health tabs
- **Space**: Pause/resume auto-refresh for detailed analysis
- **Esc**: Clear all filters and return to default view
- **Ctrl+E**: Export current view data (future enhancement)

### Core Screens and Views

1. **Real-time Dashboard**: Primary landing page with live bandwidth charts, protocol breakdown, and top talkers
2. **Flow Table Interface**: Detailed, sortable table of all network flows with advanced filtering capabilities  
3. **Flow Detail View**: Expanded view of individual flow with full metadata and historical timeline
4. **System Health Status**: Basic system metrics, capture statistics, and connection status

### Accessibility: WCAG AA

Meeting WCAG 2.1 AA standards to ensure usability for network operations teams with diverse needs, including proper color contrast for monitoring environments and keyboard navigation support.

### Branding

**Matrix-inspired cybersecurity aesthetic** with dark theme default featuring green-on-black primary text, amber warnings, and red critical alerts. Color palette uses classic terminal colors: bright green (#00FF41) for active flows, amber (#FFC107) for moderate traffic/warnings, red (#FF073A) for high traffic/alerts, and cyan (#00BCD4) for system status indicators. Typography emphasizes monospace fonts for IP addresses and technical identifiers, maintaining the authentic "digital rain" operational feeling.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Primary target is **desktop/laptop browsers** in network operations environments, with responsive design supporting tablet access for mobile network troubleshooting. No native mobile apps planned for MVP - web interface optimized for larger screens where data density is manageable.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

Single repository containing all project components (backend Go application, web frontend, documentation, configuration) for simplified development, testing, and deployment of this focused single-binary solution.

### Service Architecture

**High-Performance Go Monolith** - Single Go binary containing integrated packet capture engine, flow aggregation service, WebSocket server, REST API, and static file serving. This monolithic approach aligns with the "zero-infrastructure deployment" goal and eliminates network latency between components that would be critical for real-time packet processing.

**CRITICAL RATIONALE**: Microservices would introduce unacceptable latency for real-time packet processing and contradict the single-binary deployment requirement. The performance demands (1 Gbps capture, sub-second updates) require tightly coupled components sharing memory efficiently.

### Testing Requirements

**Unit + Integration Testing Strategy** focusing on:
- Unit tests for core packet processing and flow aggregation logic
- Integration tests for WebSocket streaming and REST API endpoints  
- Performance benchmarking tests to validate 1 Gbps capture capability
- Mock packet injection for reliable testing without requiring actual network traffic
- Automated testing pipeline that can run without raw socket permissions

**CRITICAL RATIONALE**: Given the performance requirements and packet capture complexity, comprehensive testing is essential, but E2E testing would require complex network simulation environments that may not be practical for CI/CD.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

**Programming Language & Runtime:**
- **Go 1.21+** for high-performance packet processing, excellent concurrency primitives, and single-binary compilation
- **CGO disabled** where possible to ensure truly portable binaries

**Packet Capture Technology:**
- **AF_PACKET with TPACKETv3** on Linux for zero-copy packet capture
- **Fallback to raw sockets** for broader compatibility if needed
- **Ring buffer implementation** for efficient packet queue management

**Web Technology Stack:**
- **Go standard library HTTP server** with WebSocket upgrades for minimal dependencies
- **Vanilla JavaScript frontend** with Chart.js for visualizations to avoid framework overhead
- **Embedded static assets** using Go embed for single-binary deployment

**Performance & Memory Management:**
- **Lock-free data structures** where possible for packet processing hot paths
- **Memory pooling** for packet buffer management to reduce GC pressure
- **Structured logging** with configurable levels to minimize production overhead

**Security & Deployment:**
- **Capability-based permissions** (CAP_NET_RAW) instead of requiring root access
- **TLS support** for encrypted WebSocket/API access when needed
- **Configuration via environment variables** and command-line flags only

**Development & Build:**
- **Make-based build system** for simplicity and cross-platform compatibility
- **Docker containerization** for development environment consistency
- **GitHub Actions CI/CD** for automated testing and binary releases
