# Project Brief: Netwatch MVP

## Executive Summary

**Netwatch** is a high-performance, real-time network traffic monitoring solution designed for single-host deployment at enterprise scale. The MVP delivers live visibility into network flows, bandwidth utilization, and traffic patterns through an intuitive web interface, targeting organizations that need immediate insight into their network behavior without complex multi-host infrastructure.

**Key Value Proposition:** Deploy a single Go binary to gain instant, comprehensive network visibility with real-time traffic analysis, flow monitoring, and bandwidth tracking—eliminating the complexity and cost of traditional enterprise monitoring solutions.

**Core Promise:** Transform raw network packets into actionable intelligence within seconds, enabling rapid troubleshooting, capacity planning, and security monitoring for network administrators and DevOps teams.

## Problem Statement

### The Problem
Network administrators and DevOps teams face critical visibility gaps when monitoring network traffic in real-time:

- **Reactive Troubleshooting:** Network issues are often discovered after performance degradation or outages occur
- **Limited Real-Time Visibility:** Existing tools require complex setup, multiple components, or provide delayed insights
- **Resource-Intensive Solutions:** Traditional monitoring requires dedicated infrastructure, agents, and ongoing maintenance
- **Data Accessibility:** Network flow data is often trapped in proprietary formats or complex systems

### Evidence & Impact
- Network downtime costs enterprises an average of $5,600 per minute
- 60% of network issues could be prevented with proactive monitoring
- Traditional SNMP-based monitoring provides 5-minute granularity, missing short-term spikes and anomalies
- Complex monitoring deployments take weeks to months to implement

### Current Alternatives & Limitations
- **Wireshark/tcpdump:** Manual, not scalable, no real-time dashboard
- **Enterprise SIEM/NPM:** Expensive, complex, over-engineered for single-host monitoring
- **Cloud-based solutions:** Data locality concerns, recurring costs, limited customization

## Proposed Solution

### High-Level Approach
Netwatch provides **immediate network intelligence** through a lightweight, single-binary deployment that captures, processes, and visualizes network traffic in real-time.

**Core Innovation:** Purpose-built Go application leveraging AF_PACKET ring buffers for efficient packet capture, with intelligent flow aggregation and WebSocket-powered real-time updates.

### Key Differentiators
1. **Zero-Infrastructure Deployment:** Single binary with no dependencies or complex setup
2. **High-Performance Capture:** Handles up to 1 Gbps traffic with minimal system overhead
3. **Real-Time Intelligence:** Sub-second updates to web dashboard with live flow tracking
4. **Developer-Friendly:** Clean REST API and WebSocket interface for integration
5. **Security-First:** Localhost-only binding by default, optional token authentication

### Solution Architecture
```
Network Interface → Packet Capture → Flow Aggregation → Real-Time Dashboard
```
