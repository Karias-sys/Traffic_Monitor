**Navigation Changes:**
- **Desktop:** Horizontal tab bar with full labels and keyboard shortcuts indicators
- **Tablet:** Horizontal tabs with abbreviated labels, touch-optimized 48px minimum tap targets
- **Mobile:** Bottom tab bar or hamburger menu, gesture navigation support for swipe between tabs

**Content Priority:**
- **Desktop:** Full information density - all metrics, complete flow table, detailed charts with full time controls
- **Tablet:** High priority information - essential metrics, simplified charts, flow table with horizontal scroll
- **Mobile:** Critical information only - bandwidth status, top talkers (top 5), basic system health, emergency-only functionality

**Interaction Changes:**
- **Desktop:** Keyboard shortcuts primary, mouse hover states, right-click context menus
- **Tablet:** Touch-first interface, hover states disabled, long-press for context actions, swipe gestures for charts
- **Mobile:** Touch-only, simplified interactions, essential functions only, call-to-action buttons for external tools

## Animation & Micro-interactions

### Motion Principles
**Functional Motion Philosophy:** All animations serve operational purposes - indicating data freshness, system status changes, or guiding user attention to critical information. No decorative motion that could distract from network monitoring tasks. Animations respect user preference for reduced motion and can be disabled for accessibility or performance reasons.

### Key Animations

- **Real-time Data Pulse:** Subtle 0.3-second green glow on actively updating components (Duration: 300ms, Easing: ease-in-out)
- **WebSocket Connection Status:** Connecting state shows pulsing cyan indicator, transitions to solid green when established (Duration: 1000ms pulse, Easing: ease-in-out)
- **Chart Data Updates:** Smooth line chart transitions with new data points sliding in from right, maintaining smooth 60fps during high-frequency updates (Duration: 500ms, Easing: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0.0, 0.2, 1))
- **Tab Switching:** Content cross-fade transition between dashboard/flows/health tabs (Duration: 200ms, Easing: ease-out)
- **Filter Application:** Flow table rows fade out/in when filters applied, maintaining smooth performance with virtual scrolling (Duration: 250ms, Easing: ease-in-out)
- **Alert State Transitions:** Status indicators transition smoothly between healthy/warning/error states with color morphing (Duration: 300ms, Easing: ease-in-out)
- **Loading States:** Skeleton screens with subtle shimmer effect for initial data load, replaced by content fade-in (Duration: 150ms fade, Easing: ease-out)
- **Button Interaction Feedback:** Matrix green highlight on click with micro-bounce for successful actions (Duration: 100ms, Easing: ease-out)

## Performance Considerations

### Performance Goals
- **Page Load:** Initial dashboard render within 2 seconds on desktop, 3 seconds on tablet connections
- **Interaction Response:** UI interactions respond within 100ms, maintaining real-time data update cycles
- **Animation FPS:** Maintain 60fps during chart animations and real-time updates, even during high network traffic periods

### Design Strategies
**Real-time Optimization Strategies:** Implement virtual scrolling for flow tables >1000 rows, use Canvas-based charts for high-frequency updates, batch WebSocket updates to prevent UI flooding, employ requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations during data updates.

**Progressive Loading:** Load critical dashboard components first (bandwidth chart, connection status), lazy-load secondary components (system health, detailed statistics), implement skeleton screens during initial load, prefetch flow table data in background.

**Memory Management:** Implement sliding window for historical chart data (60-minute retention), use object pooling for frequent flow updates, clean up event listeners and WebSocket connections on tab close, optimize component rendering through React.memo or similar patterns.

**Network Efficiency:** Compress WebSocket messages using binary protocols where possible, implement intelligent update throttling during high traffic (reduce update frequency from 1s to 2s when >10k flows/sec), use delta updates rather than full dataset transmission, cache static assets with long expiration headers.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Stakeholder Review:** Present complete UI/UX specification to development team and network operations stakeholders for feedback and approval
2. **Figma Wireframe Creation:** Create detailed wireframes and interactive prototypes based on the layouts and component specifications defined in this document
